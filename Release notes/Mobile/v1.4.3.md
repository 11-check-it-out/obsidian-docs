**No longer broken**
- Obsidian Sync: fixed bug causing canvas files to sometimes get deleted. If you installed v1.4.2 and don't have "Sync all other types" enabled in Sync settings, check your Sync history to see if you were affected. If you were, you can restore the files via `Sync settings â€º Deleted files.`
