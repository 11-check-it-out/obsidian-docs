## Improved

- Canvas: Added an "export to PNG" menu option to the canvas file menu. This will export a full resolution image of your Canvas.
- Canvas: Embedded canvases now show the connection lines in addition to the card boxes.

## No longer broken

- Renaming a file will no longer cause the current scroll position to be lost.
- Canvas: File-specific options have been removed file card's context menu if the card is narrowed to a specific heading.
- Canvas: Dragging a nested group will no longer try to snap to itself. This was causing some jittering.
- Canvas: Fixed an issue where following links from the canvas would prevent editor-specific hotkeys from firing.
