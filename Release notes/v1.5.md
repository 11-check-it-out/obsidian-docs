## Improvements

### Tables

- Added RTL text support.
- Tables are now automatically formatted as you type. This means columns will now render cleanly in source mode.
- Tables will no longer break when typing in the line preceding a table widget.
- The paragraph submenu is now disabled inside the table context menu.
- Typing "---" will no longer autocomplete inside a table cell.
- Fixed issue where long horizontal tables would lose their scroll position on edit.
- Fixed issue where right-clicking inside a table would cause multiple context menus to appear.
- Lots of small fixes to how we handle editing text adjacent to tables.
- Fixed table not always getting focused when using "Insert table" command.
- Fixed issue where undo/redo would put cursor in wrong position.
- You can now press backspace after a table to select the table. Pressing backspace again will delete the table.
- You can now click links and tags inside table cells.

### Editing

- Formatting commands now recognize `_` for italic and `__` for bold.
- Fixed issue where "Copy" would not work in a file where a PDF was embedded.
- "Quick font size adjustment" is now disabled by default.
- Fixed some weird behavior with "Toggle comment" command when it was used next to other comments.
- It's no longer possible to accidentally edit text inside a fold. Navigating into a fold will automatically open the fold.
- "Close" has been moved to the top in the tab menu.

### Misc

- Sync: When viewing your remote vaults inside Obsidian, you can now see the total storage space used by each vault.
- Improvements for indented text and lists in Live Preview. 

## No longer broken

- The focused item in the File Explorer will now hide after opening a file.
- Fixed the appearance of the embedded backlinks for right-to-left interfaces.
- Pressing `Home` when editing a table in source mode will now always go to the beginning of the line.
- Fixed issue where Canvas would fail to render if a zero-byte image file was embedded on the canvas.
- Fixed issue where files would fail to save when navigating between files at the same time the properties are being edited.
- Fixed Live Preview issue where tokens inside Markdown code blocks will no longer get parsed and rendered.
- Fixed Outgoing links "link" button missing for unresolved links.
- Fixed "copy" button on the Sync history modal not working.
- Fixed Outline view not showing leading numerics.
- Fixed page preview sometimes getting triggered when mouse is not hovering over the app.
- Fixed issue where Backlinks view would incorrectly render links if they are on the same line as an embed.
- We have reverted the changes to how lists are displayed in Live Preview. They will be formatted how they were in v1.4.
- Fixed `Enter`, `F2`, and `Command + ArrowDown` not working when File Explorer is focused. Enter should now open the focused file on linux/win and rename the file on macOS. F2 will rename the focused folder/file. And `Command + ArrowDown` will open the focused file on macOS.
- Editing a ordered checklist (i.e. `1. [ ]`) will no longer cause the checkboxes to get wiped out.

### macOS

- Double-clicking on the sidebar tabs will no longer trigger "maximize window."
- Fixed `View → Source Mode` and `View → Reading View` app menu items getting out of sync with the app.
- Fixed issue where dragging and dropping screenshots into Obsidian would produce broken links.

### Vim

- Fixed issue where the Vim cursor got out of sync with the app cursor. This made it possible to accidentally edit Properties inside Vim mode.
- The Vim cursor will now be hidden if the editor is not focused.
- Restyled the Vim normal mode command panel.


### Developers

- The installer has been updated to Electron v28.2.3.
