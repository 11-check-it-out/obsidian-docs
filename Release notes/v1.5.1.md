- Fixed the file explorer not remembering what folders are folded.
- Fixed the "Insert internal link" command causing the cursor to go to the end of the table.
- Fixed tables sometimes showing multiple text selections.
- Fixed the diff view in the "Sync history" modal not being scrollable.
- Fixed `x` motion in Vim mode being able to delete newlines.
