## Improvements

- macOS: Added additional formatting commands to the app menu.

## No Longer Broken

- Search: Searching for an exact property match is no longer case sensitive (e.g. `[property:value]` will also show matches for "Property").
- Properties: Making changes to the casing of a property ("property" vs. "PROPERTY") will now properly save.
- Properties: It is no longer possible to have multiple property types with the same spelling and different casing. Properties with the same spelling will now always resolve to the same property type.
- Properties: It is no longer possible to change the default property type.
- Properties: Pressing `Enter` on an empty list entry will no longer display an error message.
- Properties can no longer have both 'tag' and '#tag' as entries in the same file.
- Canvas: Frontmatter in canvas text cards will no longer be hidden.
- Properties: Fixed tag dropdown showing briefly in the top-level corner when removing a tag.
- Editor: Fixed "Insert code block" and "Insert match block" working with multiple cursors.
- macOS: Fixed "Date & time" showing as "Date time" in the property menu.
