## Canvas

Canvas is a new core plugin for Obsidian. It allows you to lay out your notes on an infinite, spatial canvas.

Canvas can be a place to synthesize your notes, a dashboard for navigating your second brain, or your new Obsidian workstation.

We’ve outlined some of the basic Canvas features in [our Help Vault](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Canvas). For more advanced usage, check out our [collection of Protips](https://obsidian.md/canvas#protips).

Then press the "Create new canvas" button on the left-side ribbon to jump right in!


## Customizable Ribbon

Ribbon items can now be rearranged (drag & drop) or hidden (right click on the ribbon for options). Configuration is also available in Settings (`Appearance › Ribbon menu`).

**Note:** if you are using an existing plugin to manage the ribbon, this might interfere.


## Developer Improvements

### Developer Changelog

We have added a [Developer Changelog](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to our API repo. Moving forward, we will keep developer-facing changes catalogued here.

### Metadata API

We've added a new metadata API for easily adding and updating frontmatter. For more basic usage information, check out [the guide in the changelog](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v110-2022-12-05--insider-build).

### In-App Improvements

The community plugins list can now be sorted by "recently updated." This should improve plugin discovery for more actively developed plugins as well as help users identify which plugins are still actively maintained.

For theme developers, we've also added theme information to the debug modal. When users submit theme related issues, now you can ask them to send the debug modal information to accelerate the information-gathering phase.

Finally, you can choose to include a `fundingUrl` in your plugin manifest. Users will be shown a link in-app to donate to you. You can put your Buy Me A Coffee links or Ko-fi here.


## Additional Improvements & Bug Fixes

- Linux: fixed middle-click to paste.
- 'Split' commands will now focus the newly created tab group.
- Fixed issue where File explorer would not always select the right items when using shift-clicking.
- Popout windows will now open with the same zoom level as the main window
- Fixed `Home` behavior in task lists.
- Moving folders to the Obsidian trash (`.trash`) will no longer add a trailing `.`
- Fix ordered lists showing as bullets.
- Plugin gallery will no longer cache the results if there's no internet connection.
- macOS: fixed issue with spell check replacing the wrong word on the same line.
- Improved styling of text when the accent color is lighter than a certain threshold.
- Fixed "Fold more" and "Fold less" commands not working properly on list items.
- The File Explorer will no longer capture arrow key events when modifier keys are used. This was breaking hotkeys such as `Ctrl + Shift + →`.

## FAQ

**Q.** Is Canvas going to be available on mobile?

> Yes! _Eventually._ The mobile version is still in development and won't be available until the new year. Canvas is one of our most ambitious undertakings to date, so it will take some time to properly adapt it to the mobile experience. We appreciate your patience.

**Q.** Why don't Canvas files show up in Search or Backlinks?

> These features are both planned and will be introduced in a later release.

**Q.** What is a `.canvas` file? Is the format open-source?

Canvas stores its data as JSON files with a special `.canvas` file extension. The JSON format is defined in [an open source spec](<https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/master/canvas.d.ts>) licensed with an MIT license.
