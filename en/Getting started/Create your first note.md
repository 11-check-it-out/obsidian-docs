Notes in Obsidian are stored as plain text files, which makes them incredibly portable. By writing your notes in plain text, they'll outlive any app—even Obsidian itself. If you plan to keep your notes for a long time, this is great news!

## Create a new note

To create a new note:

1. Press Ctrl+N (or Cmd+N on macOS) on your keyboard.
2. Type "Obsidian" as the name of your note and press Enter.
3. Copy and paste the following text into your note:

> Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files.

## Format your note

Obsidian also supports [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)—a markup language for adding formatting to plain text files.

1. Copy and paste the following text at the top of the Obsidian note:

   > \# A second brain, for you, forever.

   The hashtag (#) turns a row of text into a heading.

2. In your note, select the text "knowledge base" and press Ctrl+B (or Cmd+B on macOS) to make it bold.

To learn more about how to format your notes using Markdown, refer to [[Format your notes]].

## Read and edit your note

If you want to focus on reading, and you find the Markdown syntax distracting, you can toggle between the Reading and Editing views.

1. In the top right corner of your note, click the the glasses icon to switch to the Reading view.
2. Click the icon again (now a pen icon) to switch to the Editing view.

By default, notes use the Editing view when you first open them. You can change the default view to use when you open a new note, by setting the **Default new pane view** under **Settings** -> **Editor**.
