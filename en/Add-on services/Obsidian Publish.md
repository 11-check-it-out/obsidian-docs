Obsidian Publish is a paid hosting service for your notes.

### Privacy

Rather than publishing your entire vault, you have total control over what to publish, via the [[Publish|Publish plugin]]. ==As for the notes that you choose not the publish, Obsidian Publish has no knowledge of them==.

### Demo

There's a good chance that you're already viewing this article on our official site powdered by Obsidian Publish.

If not, you can visit it here: https://publish.obsidian.md/help.

### What's included

Obsidian Publish service lets you create your site directly from inside the Obsidian app, by choosing the notes you want to publish.

Right now, your site comes with a local graph view and table of contents. You can also see a list of all published notes on the left.

When you hover links, you can see a page preview that functions similar to the [[Page preview]] plugin in Obsidian.

To customize your site, you can choose between light and dark mode, and also toggle between readable line length and full page length.

_Note: graph view, table of contents, and page preview can be toggled off as well._

### Coming up

Obsidian Publish is still in the early days. These are the things we plan to add:

- Custom domain support
- Custom CSS support
- Backlink section
- Tag pane section
- More built-in themes

Please let us know if you have Obsidian Publish related feature requests.
