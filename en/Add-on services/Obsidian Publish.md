Obsidian Publishâ„¢ is a paid hosting service for your notes.

For instructions on how to publish your notes from within the Obsidian app, refer to the [[Publish|Publish plugin]].

### Privacy

You have total control over what to publish via the [[Publish|Publish plugin]] - either your entire vault or just selected notes within your vault. ==As for any notes you choose **not** to publish, you can be confident that those notes remain completely private, and Obsidian Publish has no knowledge of them==.

### Demo

There's a good chance that you're already viewing this article on our official site powered by Obsidian Publish.

If not, you can visit it here: https://publish.obsidian.md/help.

### What's included

The Obsidian Publish service lets you create your site directly from within the Obsidian app by choosing the notes you want to publish.

To customize your site, you can choose between light and dark mode, and also toggle between readable line length and full page length.

There are several components which can be turned on or off from the [[Publish|Publish plugin]]. Changes to these options will be reflected on your published site once the cache clears, typically within 5 minutes.

##### Navigation

Enabling this option adds a navigation sidebar displaying all published pages and the folders that contain them. Viewers will see the current open note highlighted, and can click on any other note to navigate.

##### Graph view

Displays a local graph of the page currently open. This uses the same rendering engine as the [[Graph view]] plugin in Obsidian.

##### Table of contents

Displays a table of contents for the page currently open. The list is generated from headings within the page, similar to the [[Outline]] plugin. Viewers navigating the note will see the corresponding heading highlighted as they scroll, and can click on another heading to immediately navigate to it.

##### Hover preview

When hovering over links, their content is displayed within a popup box. This works similarly to the [[Page preview]] plugin in Obsidian.
