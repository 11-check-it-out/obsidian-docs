Obsidian Publish is a paid hosting service for your notes.

For instructions on how to publish your notes from the Obsidian app, see [[Publish|Publish plugin]].

### Privacy

Rather than publishing your entire vault, you have total control over what to publish, via the [[Publish|Publish plugin]]. ==As for the notes that you choose **not** to publish, you can remain confident that those notes are completely private and Obsidian Publish has no knowledge of them==.

### Demo

There's a good chance that you're already viewing this article on our official site powdered by Obsidian Publish.

If not, you can visit it here: https://publish.obsidian.md/help.

### What's included

Obsidian Publish service lets you create your site directly from inside the Obsidian app, by choosing the notes you want to publish.

To customize your site, you can choose between light and dark mode, and also toggle between readable line length and full page length.

There are several components which can be turned on or off from the [[Publish|Publish plugin]]. This will reflect on the published site once the cache clears, usually within 5 minutes.

##### Navigation

Turning this on adds a navigation sidebar containing all published pages and the folders that contain them. Viewers will see the current open note highlighted, and can click on another note to navigate.

##### Graph view

Shows a local graph of the page currently open. This uses the same rendering engine as the [[Graph view]] plugin in Obsidian.

##### Table of contents

Shows the table of contents for the page currently open. The list is generated from headings within the page, similar to the [[Outline]] plugin. Viewers navigating the note will see the corresponding heading highlighted when they scroll, and can click on another heading to scroll to it.

##### Hover preview

Allows the viewer to hover over links to view their content in a popup box. This works similarly to the [[Page preview]] plugin in Obsidian.


### Coming up

Obsidian Publish is still in the early days. These are the things we plan to add:

- Custom domain support
- Custom CSS support
- Backlink section
- Tag pane section
- More built-in themes
