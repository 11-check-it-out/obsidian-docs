Obsidian currently offers two types of discounts: education and non-profit. They both give you 40% off our add-on services, including [[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]] and [[Introduction to Obsidian Publish|Obsidian Publish]].

### Eligibility

If you are a student or faculty member of an education organization like a university or a high school, you generally can qualify for education discount.

If you run or work at a non-profit organization, you generally can qualify for non-profit discount.

### How to apply

1. Go to [your account page](https://obsidian.md/).
2. Under **Payment & billing**, find the **Discount** section, and click on the **"Apply"** link.
3. Select a discount type depending on your situation, fill out your **school or organization email** (not your account email).
4. Click "Send application".
5. In your school or organization email inbox, you should get an email from us to verify your email address. Click on the link to verify.
6. You might get instantly approved for the discount. If not, our team will review your application as soon as we can.
7. You’ll get an email when your discount gets approved.

Congratulations! Now you’ll see the discount when you try to purchase Obsidian Sync or Publish.

### How to renew

Once you have an active discount, you can see how it will expire under **Payment & billing** → **Discount** on [your account page](https://obsidian.md/).

A week before your discount expires, you will get an email reminder to renew it. You can follow the same steps in "[[#How to apply]]" to renew the discount, if you still qualify for it.
