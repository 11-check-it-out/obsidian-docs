The Publish plugin lets you publish notes from your vault onto your site, all within Obsidian.

### Enable the plugin

First, enable the Publish plugin. After that, you'll see the Publish icon appear in your [[Ribbon]], which looks like a paper plane.

As always, you can also set a hotkey for this option, or use the command palette to access it.

### Set up your site

When purchasing Obsidian Publish, you'll be asked how many sites to purchase. You can then log in under Settings -> Account, so that the Publish plugin is aware of the number of remote sites you have.

If you have available slots, after opening Publish, you'll see an option to set up a site by entering a unique site ID. Your site will be available at `https://publish.obisidian.md/{site-id}`.

### Site options

After creating a site, you might want to give it a name, set a theme, and toggle the modules (graph view, table of contents, etc.). You can do that by clicking on the gear icon near your site name, once you've created it.

### Upload files

After setting up your site, you can now publish some notes!

With a fresh, empty site, all the notes will appear under the "New" section, meaning they are new to your site.

==Note that at this stage, our Obsidian Publish servers has no knowledge of these "New" notes. They are displayed as the Publish plugin compares what's in your vault with what's already on your published site.==

Now, you can choose the files you want to publish, and click on the "Publish" button.

### Make changes

As you make changes to notes that you already published, those changes will be automatically selected when you open the Publish plugin dialogue, but you can still uncheck some of them and partially publish your changes.

### Add linked notes

One common thing you might want to do is to select an "entry point" note, and add all the notes linked from there.

To do this, first select the entry point note. Then, click on the "Add linked" button on the top right corner of the dialogue. If your entry point note links to 4 more files, all those 4 files will be automatically selected.

You can click the button multiple times to include everything indirectly linked from the original entry point note. This is a bit risky, as one of the note might link to something you do not wish to publish, so please review the list of files carefully before hitting "Publish".

Using the "Add linked" button is a good way to ensure there are no dead links on your published site, as all the linked notes are added and subsequently published to your site.
