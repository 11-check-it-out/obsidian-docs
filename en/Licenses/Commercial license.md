If you're using Obsidian for commercial use in a company of two (2) or more employees, you need to purchase a Commercial license.

Commercial use includes, but is not limited to, work-related activities such as:

- Meeting notes
- Project notes for teams
- Organizational wikis

You don't need a Commercial license if you work in any of the following settings:

- Schools and recognized educational institutions
- Non-commercial research
- Non-profit organizations
- Freelancing or companies with a single person

You can evaluate Obsidian for commercial use for 14 days. To purchase a commercial license, visit the [pricing page](https://obsidian.md/pricing).
