### The options

We understand that this change is not for everyone. You have a few options below (you can change your mind anytime!):

#### 1. Hide formatting

**If you**: like to hide formatting and see the images and embeds right in the editor, we suggest you try the new Live Preview.

**What to do**:

1. Open **Settings**.
2. In the sidebar, click **Editor** if it's not already open.
3. Under **General**, turn off **Use legacy editor** if it's not off already. After turning it off, click on the **Relaunch** button for it to take effect.
4. After Obsidian restarts, open **Settings**.
5. In the sidebar, click **Editor**.
6. Under **General**, set **Default editing mode** to **Live Preview**.
7. All newly opened panes will use Live Preview at this point. If you already have some panes open, they will show **Source View**. To change this, in the **More options** menu of the pane, select **Toggle Live Preview/Source View**. Alternatively, you can open [[Command palette]] and search for the **Toggle Live Preview/Source View** command.

#### 2. I like seeing Markdown

**If you**: like to continue seeing Markdown and would also like an updated editor engine, you can use the the new Source View.

**What to do**:

1. Open **Settings**.
2. In the sidebar, click **Editor** if it's not already open.
3. Under **General**, turn off **Use legacy editor** if it's not off already. After turning it off, click on the **Relaunch** button for it to take effect.

**Pros**: There are some new features like spellchecker and text substitution on macOS. Vim mode is also supported.

**Cons**: Some community plugins might not be fully compatible yet; Vim mode is experimental.

#### 3. I've been using Obsidian and I like the way things are (this is the default)

**If you**: find that the new editor breaks the plugins, themes, and snippets you currently, we suggest you use the Legacy Editor with Source View.

**What to do**:

1. Open **Settings**.
2. In the sidebar, click **Editor** if it's not already open.
3. Under **General**, turn on **Use legacy editor** if it's not on already. After turning it on, click on the **Relaunch** button for it to take effect.

**Pros**: everything stays the same! If you're not in the mood for any change in your usage at the moment, this is the safest option.

**Cons**: you might miss out on some sweet features described above, but you can switch to option 1 or 2 any time.
