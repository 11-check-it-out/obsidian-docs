Live Preview is introduced to help you preview what you're writing on the go, as well as hide Markdown formatting.

We understand that this change is not for everyone. You have a few options below (you can change your mind anytime!):

#### 1. Hide formatting

**If you**: like to hide formatting and see the images and embeds right in the editor, we suggest you try the new Live Preview.

**What to do**: go to Settings -> Editor -> General, and set "Default editing mode" to "Live Preview". Existing panes will retain its mode, please use the "Toggle source/live preview mode" on existing panes or close them.

#### 2. I like my Markdown

**If you**: like to continue seeing Markdown and would also like an updated editor engine, you can use the the new Source View.

**What to do**: go to Settings -> Editor -> General, and set "Default editing mode" to "Source View", and make sure "Legacy Editor" is *turned off*. Existing panes will retain its mode, please use the "Toggle source/live preview mode" on existing panes or close them.

**Pros**: There are some new features like spellchecker and text substitution on macOS. Vim mode is also supported.

**Cons**: Some community plugins might not be fully compatible yet; Vim mode is experimental.

#### 3. I like the way things are

**If you**: find community plugins broken by the new editor, we suggest you use the Legacy Editor with Source View.

**What to do**: go to Settings -> Editor -> General, and set "Default editing mode" to "Source View", and make sure "Legacy Editor" is *turned on*. You will need to restart Obsidian for this to take effect.

**Pros**: everything stays the same! If you're not in the mood for any change in your usage at the moment, this is the safest option.

**Cons**: you might miss out on some sweet features described above, but you can switch to option 1 or 2 any time.
