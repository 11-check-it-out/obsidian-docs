There are many ways to drag and drop things around Obsidian to make the experience smoother:

### Drag sources

- You can drag a file, or multiple files from the file explorer.
- You can drag a file from a search result.
- You can drag a file from the backlink pane or an unlinked reference.
- You can drag a file from the starred pane.

### Drop destinations

- You can drop a file on a pane header to open the file there. Hold `Alt` to drop anywhere on the pane.
- You can drop a file on a folder in the file explorer to move the file there.
- You can drop a file into an editor to insert it as a link. The generated link also follows your preferences, such as relative paths, or using markdown links.
- You can drop a file on the starred pane to star it.

### Dragging from outside Obsidian

- You can drag any HTML content from the browser into Obsidian to automatically convert them into Markdown
- You can drag and drop any files from your native file explorer to create `file:///` absolute links to those files. Hold `Ctrl/Cmd` to have Obsidian import (make a copy of) those files in your vault attachment folder and insert them as internal links.

### Dropping files outside Obsidian

- This will create an `obsidian://` URL in the external application for the Obsidian note that you dragged.
